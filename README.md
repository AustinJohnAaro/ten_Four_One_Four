Thanks for resubmitting, 
Austin.  
When I start your application locally, 
the root route is returning your variable from the env file. 
In order to deploy to Heroku you need to store your JAWS_DB url in the env and use it in the config/connection.js.  
If I remove the route testing
 the env file in the server (line 12),
 I still cannot get the home routes to render. 
 I'm going to mark incomplete for now. 
 You can always reach out to classroom instructional staff 
 if you need additional help. 
 Good luck! 
 Go gurgle your mouth out with a reveolver :)
